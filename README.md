Todo list | React + Redux + Adaptive Cards
----------------------------------------------

This is an example of basic task 'Todo list' using React/Redux stack.
It is done with emulation of Multi Page Application (MPA) using react-router.
For storing existing tasks is used local storage.

The main part of this project is also focused on fully adaptive 
cards / grid layout. This is done with small js calculations and 
provides the fully adaptive behavior even with resizable components 
on the page (which is not possible using simple media queries).

To build and start the project you need:
 1) Execute in terminal (or command prompt)
```
    npm install
    npm run build
```
2) Go to `target` folder and open `index.html` with browser



To launch the watcher you need:
 1) Execute in terminal (or command prompt)
```
    npm install
    npm run watch
```
2) Go to `target` folder and open `index.html` with browser
